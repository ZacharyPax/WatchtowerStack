This directory contains custom HTML used in Watchtower.

Although Watchtower Observatory is quite specific to our environment, Sankey SOC Elastic Push can be super useful to anyone who wants people who are not super familiar with Lucene to use Security Onion's Sankey feature via Elasticsearch.

To use it in your environment, simply download it and change "wt-secure-redirect.local" to your instance of Security Onion, and all the other relevant data should simply get piped in automatically.
