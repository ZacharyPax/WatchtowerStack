This directory contains Onion Query Language (OQL) queries that are inputted into the Security Onion dashboard to give a specific result.

Because copying and pasting these queries is time consuming and kinda stupid, I suggest making an HTML dashboard for the ones you like. Just like the other Lucene queries, these can be modified, although they are quite specific to our environment.

See the watchtower-observatory HTML for the formatting of how to input queries into the HTML to automatically propagate the query in the dashboard.
