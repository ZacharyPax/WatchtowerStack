Watchtower 2.1.0

Deployed new node Zipporah

Moved Jehoahaz to Zipporah

Re-allocated RAM for Korah after Jehoahaz was moved

Fixed bugs and added Zipporah to Grafana Dashboard

Fixed alerting due to SSH cluster communication on Grafana

Added dedicated network switch "Elijah" between Zipporah and Eve so that Jehoahaz, Hezekiah, and Vashti can communicate without entering Meraki stack

Result of changes:

Incredibly dramatic increases in performance in Grafana and Prometheus
