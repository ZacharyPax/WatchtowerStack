Changelog 1-26-2024

Watchtower 2.0.0

Moved Vashti from non-LVM to LVM storage

Created 10GB unallocated space on Vashti's virtual drive

This will prevent exhausting the thin volume of space because I allocated like 5GB over accidentally


Result of changes:

Maintenance performed to prevent the possibility of issues in the future
