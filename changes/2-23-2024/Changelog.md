Watchtower 2.1.0

Released Watchtower 2.1.0 after confirming final bug is fixed. Major thanks to Stuti Gupta from the Wazuh Team again.

Added a new panel on the VirusTotal API dashboard for files whose hashes aren't in the database.

Created an Electron app with a special configuration to allow Watchtower SSL certificates. Probably going to be working on that for a bit.

New features, bug fixes, and UI improvements.
