Changelog 2-2-2024

Watchtower 2.0.0

TCP 57314 opened on David for Strelka UI Docker container on Korah

Changed Docker environment to get that to work

Result of changes:

Working proof of concept for YARA interface. Planning to automate zeek decoded executable files into this Strelka UI.

They're already doing so but having it go through this interface in addition to JA3/YARA hash enables more visibility.
