Welcome to the Watchtower Stack repository! ðŸš€ This repository houses configuration files and essential information for the Watchtower Stack, a robust hardware server cluster powered by the Linux-based, free, and open-source hypervisor, Proxmox Virtual Environment.

### Overview

Watchtower is meticulously designed to offer comprehensive visibility into your network, coupled with advanced alerting capabilities based on network traffic and system telemetry. This ensures top-notch network security by ingesting data from endpoints and the network itself.

### Stack Features

1. Network intrusion detection and monitoring via Security Onion
2. Full packet capture via Stenographer
3. Full endpoint event visibility via Wazuh
4. Instantaneous status monitoring for mission-critical systems via Prometheus
5. Automatic software inventory system via Wazuh
6. ARP table monitoring via Arpwatch (optional)
7. Easy-to-use interface via custom HTML and Dashy
8. Ultra-long-term forensic storage of network connections indexed by Zeek via the Watchtower-Forensic Datastore
9. A global dashboard to monitor network and system status from all data ingest points via Grafana
10. So much more! (Wow!)
