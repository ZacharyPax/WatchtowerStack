This directory contains the stuff used to compile the Watchtower Electron App.

The Watchtower Electron App is a convenient front-end to wt.local and other Watchtower services.

To compile the electron app, you need to use np, nodejs, and electron. Some dependencies might not be GPLv3 compatible, so they're not included here.
