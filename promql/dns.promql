# Prometheus Query Language Query
# Used for alerting/dashboard purposes in Grafana or in the Prometheus Database directly on Vashti
# This query calculates the DNS queries per second averaged over a three-minute period. This relies on Windows telemetry.
# The stack is capable of calculating this from network ingest too, but it is much less efficient.
